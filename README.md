For this project, my idea was to create a site that would provide data on the Kanto region of the Pokémon franchise. The beginning of the game was a huge inspiration for how I set up the modal because you, the player got to choose Bulbasaur, Charmander, or Squirtle as your starter. They were each in a pokéball on a table and when you walked up to one, a prompt opened up that gave general information as well as asking if you were going to select this Pokémon. When you opened the pokéball, the pokémon inside would make a noise and information pertaining to their type, height, weight, abilities, and move set were shown in a text box which I decided to turn into a modal. Shortly afterwards, Professor Oak would give you a pokedex. I decided to make an ajax using an api that would list all of the original 151 Pokémon.
